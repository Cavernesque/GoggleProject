# GoggleProject
Code was written for a Halloween costume - the fictional steampunk Professor, Sir Charles Matheson.

Written for an Arduino Uno, the code has a number of utilities for controlling multiplexed LEDs in a set of goggles. It exploits some fun properties of multiplexed devices
to create a stroboscopic display in the goggles' right eye.
